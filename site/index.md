# How Far Away Can You See It?

This is a fork of the earthcalc calculator: [available on GitHub.com][source-code]

The original earthcalc calculator answers an interesting question

How much of a distant object is obscured by the curvature of the Earth?

This calculator solves a related, but slightly different question,
what is the maximum distance from which you can see the top of a tall
object?

The following assumptions are still made.
* the earth is a convex sphere of radius 6371 kilometres
* light travels in straight lines
