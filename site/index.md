# How Far Away Can You See It?

This is a fork of the earthcalc calculator:

The original earthcalc calculator answers an interesting question

How much of a distant object is obscured by the curvature of the Earth?

This calculator solves a related, but slightly different question,
what is the maximum distance from which you can see the top of a tall
object?

This can also be run in reverse as a "how far away can I see from the top of...."
calculator, just set your height to 0.
(This is effectively isomorphic to a "distance to horizon" calculator in
this case.)


The following assumptions are still made.
* the earth is a convex sphere of radius 6371 kilometres
* light travels in straight lines
